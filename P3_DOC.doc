I.) 
We used the Factory design pattern to consolidate branch statements to handle permissions differences between Android API versions. The abstract class AndroidVersionFactory defines the methods that each version factory must implement and contains helper methods for shared code. There are two factory classes that implement this pattern, LollipopFactory and MarshmallowFactory. CreateContact utilizes the factories in its onCreate method.

II.)
Test classes are located in the directory:
ContactManager\app\src\test\java\com\example\contactmanager 

III.)
All of the files required to run the program are included in the repository. Simply download or clone the repository onto the local machine and then open it with Android Studio. Next, open the MainActivity class, then Run the MainActivity class. The android application can be run using the emulator or installed onto a physical Android phone.
